* subclass mpkControl for keyboard and drumpads
	* events and handlers are different
	* mapping is a property - how to invoke functions with a different scope?
* make drumpad handlers
* use buffers for drum samples (if you use them)
* open source MPK handler
	* generalize further
	* document better
	* give examples
